Title: Pelican Static Site Generator
Date: 2024-09-15 17:00

I'm migrating my old blogs on various sites to github pages.  The default static site generator on github pages is Jekyll, which is written in Ruby.  I tried it out briefly, but decided to go for a generator written in the more familiar Python, thus Pelican.  So far I like it.  I pretty quickly found a theme I like, and forked it to switch out the background image.  I pulled the forked theme into this repo with a git submodule.
