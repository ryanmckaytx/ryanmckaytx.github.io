[TOC]

I've been really fortunate through the years to be surrounded by people who are dedicated to continuous learning and improvement.  A few years ago, I put together a reading list as part of an engineering department reboot.  I updated it late last year.  I have rough reading/discussion times for some of it.  What am I missing?  

## Notes
* Video time slots are roughly 80% watching, 20% discussion
* Reading time slots are roughly 66% reading, 33% discussion
* Long chapters are broken up into 2 sessions
